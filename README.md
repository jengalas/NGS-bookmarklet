NGS-bookmarklet
===============

This is a very simple bookmarklet that prompts for a National Geodetic Survey benchmark PID and directly accesses the datasheet for the corresponding mark, bypassing the cumbersome NGS search page (but adding the restriction that the PID must be known).

Create a new bookmark with the code in pid-search.min.js, prefixed with `javascript:`, as the targetâ€”or drag the link from the HTML page to your Bookmarks Toolbar/Favorites Bar.

Future plans are to implement some of the other methods of mark retrieval, as described here:
